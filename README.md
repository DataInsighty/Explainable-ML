# Explainable Machine Learning for Diabetes Prediction Using the Pima Indians Dataset

# Overview
This project applies Explainable Machine Learning (ML) techniques to predict diabetes using the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset. With diabetes posing significant health risks globally, the project aims to create interpretable and accurate ML models to assist healthcare practitioners in decision-making. Techniques like SHAP, LIME, and Partial Dependency Plots ensure that the predictions are not only accurate but also comprehensible and actionable.

# Key Features
Dataset Overview:

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Size: 768 records with 8 features.

Features include Glucose, BMI, Age, Blood Pressure, and others, with "Outcome" indicating diabetes status.
Methodology:

Preprocessing: Balanced the dataset using SMOTE to handle class imbalance.
Scaled features using Min-Max scaling.

Model Training: Trained an XGBoost classifier for accurate and efficient predictions.
Enhanced model performance with Bayesian hyperparameter tuning.

Explainability: Applied SHAP, LIME, and feature importance techniques for model interpretability.
Explainability Highlights:

SHAP Summary Plot: Glucose, BMI, and Age were identified as the most critical features for predicting diabetes.
LIME Explanations: Provided detailed local explanations for individual predictions.
Partial Dependency Plots: Highlighted the relationship between key features and the outcome.
Ethical Considerations:

Ensured fairness by examining potential biases in the dataset.
Maintained strict compliance with data privacy and security standards (e.g., HIPAA).
Key Findings
Model Performance:

Achieved high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Demonstrated strong interpretability with SHAP, enabling better understanding of predictions.

# Feature Insights:
Glucose: The most significant predictor of diabetes.

BMI and Age: Strongly correlated with diabetes risk.

# Comparison with Generative AI:
Explainable ML techniques outperform generative AI in terms of interpretability and applicability for healthcare diagnostics.
